<p class="lead">As one of our design principles we've worked to put assets and links to assets where you expect to find them. Below is a comprehensive guide to what's available and where to find them.</p>

This list will be further flushed out in the September design sprint.

This will (likely) be two large spheres:
1. Stuff on github
    - Breakout which repos have what
    - Link to [repo naming blog post](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2017/07/05/name-it-for-what-it-does/)
1. Stuff on owncloud
    - PPT, DOC, InDesign templates (I'm guessing that's the best way to share across EMBL?)

- [Files](https://oc.embl.de) (Link only, you'll need to request access to OwnCloud)
