<p class="lead">The EMBL Design Language is the branding, visual standards and tools for all EMBL websites, services, brochures, slides, and other documents. It puts the focus on the EMBL spirit, it reminds that we are all part of one institute.</p>

The Language is one half of the coin; the other half is the EMBL Design Lab, a collaborative forum for support and improvement of the EMBL Design Language.

#### A note about what you're seeing on this site
This is an initial concept of what **part** of an EMBL-branded site could look like.

It shows:
- Typography
- Spacing rhythms
- Use of patterns

It does NOT show:
- Colour use (note the logo is also monotone)
- Navigation structure and menu patterns
- Data-rich patterns (like tables and application interfaces)

This site serves as part of the discussion and might serve as a build block for further work in September 2017.

### Purpose
It is useful to recall [EMBL's mission](https://www.embl.de/aboutus/communication_outreach/publications/programme/programme17-21_executive-summary.pdf):

> EMBL is Europe’s centre of excellence in life science research, services and training. It was founded in 1974 by its member states as an intergovernmental organisation to promote the molecular life sciences in Europe and beyond.

And EMBL's "[five missions and the Programme 2017—2021](https://www.embl.de/aboutus/communication_outreach/publications/programme/programme17-21_executive-summary.pdf)":
> 1. Forefront *research*: uncovering the molecular basis of life
> 1. Providing world-class *research infrastructure and services*
> 1. *Training* and inspiring the next generation of leading scientists
> 1. Driving research, innovation and progress through technology development, interactions with *industry and technology transfer*
> 1. Playing a leading role in the *integration* of life science research in Europe
