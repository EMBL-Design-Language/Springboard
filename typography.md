### Typeface
The typeface used by EMBL on all its communication materials is called Fira. Fira is an open source typeface developed by Erik Spiekermann for Mozilla's Firefox OS. It was chosen through a lengthy process by the EMBL corporate design team to more accurately reflect EMBL's character compared to its predecessor, Helvetica.

Fira was selected because it had a large selection of weights available. It is open source and therefore mitigates license costs. It is highly legible at small size and due to the variety in the letterforms, reads extremely well as a body copy font. It is also available as a web font and for desktop. For a detailed overview of the process and rationale of selection, please read this blog post.

### Weights

Fira has 62 weights split across a sans, condensed, compressed and two types of monospace.

This huge amounts of weights provides a large amount of design freedom and flexibility, whilst retaining
