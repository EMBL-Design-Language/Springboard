<p class="lead">The EMBL Design Language is the branding, visual standards and tools for all EMBL websites, services, brochures, slides, and other documents. It puts the focus on the EMBL spirit, it reminds that we are all part of one institute.</p>

The Language is one half of the coin; the other half is the EMBL Design Lab, a collaborative forum for support and improvement of the EMBL Design Language.

#### A note about what you're seeing on this site

This is an initial concept of what **part** of an EMBL-branded site could look like. It serves as part of the discussion and might serve as a build block for further work in September 2017.

| Typography (the Fira font) |  Colour use (note the logo is also monotone) |
| Spacing rhythms (whitespace) | Navigation structure and menu patterns |
| Use of visual patterns as imagery | Data-rich patterns (like tables and application interfaces) |
| Information hierarchy (contextual placement of title, site name, footer, etc.)  | |
