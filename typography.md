### Typeface
The typeface used by EMBL on all communication materials is called [Fira](https://carrois.com/typefaces/FiraSans/#!layout=specimen). Fira is an open source typeface developed by Erik Spiekermann for Mozilla's Firefox OS. It was chosen through a lengthy process by the EMBL corporate design team to more accurately reflect EMBL's character compared to its predecessor, Helvetica.

Fira was selected because it had a large selection of weights available. It is open source and therefore mitigates license costs. It is highly legible at small size and due to the variety in the letterforms, reads extremely well as a body copy font. It is also available as a web font and for desktop. For a detailed overview of the process and rationale of selection, please read this blog post.

Fira is a supported, ongoing open source project. Work in progress includes additional major language support for Arabic, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.

### Weights

Fira has 16 weights in two styles Roman and Italic. There is also companion Condensed, Condensed Italic, Compressed, and Compressed Italic weights.

This huge amounts of weights provides a large amount of design freedom and flexibility, whilst retaining brand integrity.


### Characteristics

#### Inline CAPITALS for acronyms 
Fira's capital letters have been designed in such a way that when used for acronyms the readability of the text is not hampered in any way.

#### Wide variety of glyphs
Fira has a wide variety of standard extended latin glyphs from which to typeset from. Of particular interest to EMBL are numerals and scientific characters.
