<p class="lead">As one of our design principles we've worked to put assets and links to assets where you expect to find them. Below is a comprehensive guide to what's available and where to find them.</p>

{% include navigation_list.html %}

A list (or better yet: map).

This will (likely) be two large spheres:
1. Stuff on github
    - Breakout which repos have what
    - Link to [repo naming blog post](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2017/07/05/name-it-for-what-it-does/)
1. Stuff on owncloud
    - PPT, DOC, InDesign templates (I'm guessing that's the best way to share across EMBL?)
