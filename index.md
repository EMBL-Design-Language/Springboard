<p class="lead">The EMBL Design Language is the branding, visual standards and tools for all EMBL websites, services, brochures, slides, and other documents. It puts the focus on the EMBL spirit, it reminds that we are all part of one institute.</p>

The Language is one half of the coin; the other half is the EMBL Design Lab, a collaborative forum for support and improvement of the EMBL Design Language.

### Purpose
It is useful to recall [EMBL's mission](https://www.embl.de/aboutus/communication_outreach/publications/programme/programme17-21_executive-summary.pdf):

> EMBL is Europe’s centre of excellence in life science research, services and training. It was founded in 1974 by its member states as an intergovernmental organisation to promote the molecular life sciences in Europe and beyond.

And EMBL's "[five missions and the Programme 2017—2021](https://www.embl.de/aboutus/communication_outreach/publications/programme/programme17-21_executive-summary.pdf)":
1. Forefront *research*: uncovering the molecular basis of life
1. Providing world-class *research infrastructure and services*
1. *Training* and inspiring the next generation of leading scientists
1. Driving research, innovation and progress through technology development, interactions with *industry and technology transfer*
1. Playing a leading role in the *integration* of life science research in Europe
